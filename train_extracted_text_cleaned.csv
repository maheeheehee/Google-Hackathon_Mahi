DESIGN ON DISPLAY: (Condition And Rendition of Copy)

COMMENTS: (Description of Location or Rotary Plan, Brand Category Competition)

This is a comparatively easy market to cover. It is less than an hour from Tampa
airport. Our bulletins are on every major arterial and in all quadrants of the area.
No changes were made. Some minor on-premise blocking and trees were noted, but not
deemed serious enough for correction.

The only other tobacco in the market was a standing 6 Panel RJR buy currently showing
Camel.

‘COMMENTS ON PLANT: (Condition, Structures, Painting Abily, Lighting, Cooperation, etc.)

The plant is well maintained and covers all parts of the market. Lamar looks like a
good citizen here, keeping a good-looking operation. doing public service, and
carrying a lot of local advertisers.

PROJEGT DESCRIPTION

The Cigarette Test Station (0TS400).combines many of the stand-alone instruments that

R&D currently uses to measure cigarette weight, pressure drop, ventilation, and

hardness into one compact module. The CTS400 has the additional measurement of

edgarette hardness in comparison with the C1S300. With this added measurement R&D will »
de able to replace the Firmess Integrator that measures cigarette firmess in addition

to other measurements that are mentioned above. The Firrness Integrator is no longer
manufactured and parts are becoming difficult to obtain. Lastly, purchase of thie

instrument vould provide similar capability as the Macon Plant and help facilitate
comparisions between laboratories.

‘are now up to.74 respondents who have been sent cigarettes. Hopetully we wil get a lot

of callbacks this weekend.
